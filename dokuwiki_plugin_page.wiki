===== What's it for? =====

This plugin provides a helper class that manages the amount of occurences of any given object.

There are two simple mechanics that can be used.

  - incUsageOf(string $id) - indicates to the helper that the object with the given identifier is used (once more). The helper internally counts the amount of uses for this identifier.
  - amountOfUses(string $id) - returns an integer value of the amount of uses.

The helper is implemented as a Singleton instance, so a particular identifier could be used accross multiple plugins. Keep this in mind when choosing an identifier.
